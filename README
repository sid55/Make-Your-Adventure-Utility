Makefile
-It has the commands necessary to remove and recompile the classes.

cyoa.java
-This java class functions as a choose-your-own-adventure utility.
 The user can type in any file that contains any adventure as the
 argument for this java class and this java class will act as a line
 by line reader of the file and allows the user to play the game.

LinkedList.java
-This java class funtions as a doubly linked list with one extra set 
 of pointers. This doubly linked list is a custom variation of an actual
 doubly linked list and thus has more nodes acting as pointers. Additionally,
 each node in this class holds four separate hashtables, each with
 their own functionalities.

demo.adventure
-This is the adventure text file I have created to act as an argument
 for cyoa.java. The user can change the file that they want to enter 
 as an argument but that file should have text following the same format.

design.pdf
-This is a design document for this project. It contains information
 regarding which data structures I have used and why I have used them.
 It explains the changes I have made towards the design of this 
 project as the project progessed.

Note about what this project is about:
-In this project I have created a program that 
 that makes use of a doubly linked list and hashtables.
 This program allows the compilation of any file the
 user enters if it contains the proper information
 and then runs the game that the user has chosen.

Notes about compiling and running:
-In order to compile this program use the makefile by typing 
 in "make all" into the command line. This test allows the
 compilation of the program. To allow the program to compile
 and then run type in "make test".
